This Project was created in order to practice rendering apps with React. This application was built from scratch.

The purpose of this app is to store, edit and even deleted cooking recipes. This was designed to hone skills in React, Nodejs and CSS by downloading packages with NPM, rendering state, manipulating and managing React components and much more.

If you have any questions on the project or coding in general please let me know!
